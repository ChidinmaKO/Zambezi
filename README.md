#### Why Zambezi?

This repo is named after [the Zambezi River](https://www.zambiatourism.com/destinations/rivers/zambezi/). The Zambezi River originates in the Mwinilunga District in north-west Zambia. It's the fourth-longest river in Africa, the longest east-flowing river in Africa and the largest flowing into the Indian Ocean from Africa!

The Zambezi flows through six countries in total: [Zambia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambia)ğŸ‡¿ğŸ‡², [Angola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angola)ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡´, [Namibia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia)ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡¦, [Botswana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana)ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¼, [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe)ğŸ‡¿ğŸ‡¼, and then across [Mozambique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique)ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¿ to the [Indian Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean). The Zambezi River also forms the border of Zambia and Namibia, Zambia and Botswana, and Zambia and Zimbabwe.

One of the waterfalls on the Zambezi is [Lake Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Victoria) which is one of the seven natural wonders of the world!
